# Game-of-Charity

This was a small project I gave myself to practice my HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript (Not responsive.. yet).


I'm a big UFC fan and decided to make a single web page for an upcoming event, Fight Night 153.  Under the promo video you see when loading the page, the main card fades in with three other fights on the main card. When you click one of the three fights the fighter's images pop up and their stats will show below their images.


Under the fighters stats are other upcoming events (sorry the links are not active).

By downloading and opening the index.html file in you browser (preferably Chrome), you can see my small web project.
